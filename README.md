# Evolutionary Steering Behaviors Simulation

## Description

This project implements an artificial intelligence simulation using Python and the Pygame library. The simulation focuses on the evolution of intelligent steering behaviors in virtual vehicles. These vehicles navigate towards food sources while avoiding poisons, showcasing adaptive behaviors over generations through the integration of a genetic algorithm.

## Features

- **Adaptive Navigation**: Vehicles evolve to demonstrate improved steering behaviors over generations.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Implemented genetic algorithm for evolving and mutating vehicle behaviors.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Vehicles navigate to find food while avoiding poisons in a dynamically changing environment.
- **Python and Pygame**: Developed using Python programming language and Pygame library for game-like visualization.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install required dependencies using `pip install pygame`.
3. Run the simulation by executing `python main.py`.
